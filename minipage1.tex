\mysection{Summary} 
I am young and ambitious. I am interested in developing solutions to
interesting and diverse technical and intellectual problems. I am very
keen on algorithms and physics. I have 7+ years of experience working
with C++, strong background in computer science, math and physics,
solid knowledge of algorithms and data structures, experience with the
design and implementation of complex algorithms. I am able to learn
new subjects quickly and thoroughly.

%{Software Developer}
%{Chaos Group}{Sofia, Bulgaria}
%{Involved in Development and maintenance of raytracer V-Ray and fluid simulator PhoenixFD, formation of company public image and mentoring interns.}
%{Integrated Embree library in V-Ray core, which resulted on average in 10\% better render times. Solved some precision problems in both Embree and V-Ray. Optimized V-Ray hair shading and improved Embree hair intersection model.}
%{Gained experience of cross platform software development, working in large team, code reviews, git, cmake, sse intrinsics.}
