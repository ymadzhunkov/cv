\mysection{Summary} 
I am young, ambitious and very keen on algorithms and physics. I am interested
in developing solutions to diverse technical and intellectual
problems. I have strong background in computer science, math and physics. I
have 7+ years of experience with C++. I have experience with the design and
implementation of complex algorithms and optimizing implementations on both the
high (conceptual) and low (CPU, cache, parallel processing) level. I am able
to learn new subjects quickly and thoroughly.
