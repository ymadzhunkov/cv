\section*{Summary} 
I am young and ambitious. I am interested in solving challenging
problems. I am very keen on algorithms and physics. I have 7+ years of
experience working with C++. I have strong background in computer
science, math and physics. I have a solid knowledge of algorithms and
data structures. I have experience with the design and implementation
of complex algorithms. I am able to learn new subjects quickly and
thoroughly.
