  abstract={vmcPET, a VMC ++ based fast code for simulating photon transport through the patient geometry for use in positron emission tomography related calculations, is presented. vmcPET is shown to be between 250 and 425 times faster than GATE in completely analog mode and up to 50000 times faster when using advanced variance reduction techniques. Excellent agreement between vmcPET and EGSnrc and GATE benchmarks is found. vmcPET is coupled to GATE via phase-space files of particles emerging from the patient geometry.}
